# YC-Companies

This is a continuation from my Unit 2 Build Project. I want to take a bunch of startups and create a model that can have prediction power on whether 
or not they will go on to raise an additional round of funding. This will be one piece of a complete application that would be a sourcing model for 
VC's interested in early stage startups.
