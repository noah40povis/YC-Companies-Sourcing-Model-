# YC-Companies

This is a continuation from my Unit 2 Build Project. I want to take a bunch of startups and create a model that can have prediction power on whether 
or not they will go on to raise an additional round of funding. This will be one piece of a complete application that would be a sourcing model for 
VC's interested in early stage startups. 

## Steps for project. 

1. Webscrape startups 
2. Webscrape individual startups information
3. Convert webscraped data into a dataframe for cleaning and wrangling
4. Build a classification model 
5. Assess model 
6. Based on model, decide whether or not to continue to build out sourcing application
